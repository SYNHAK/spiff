Developing Spiff
================

Spiff is hosted on GitHub: http://github.com/synhak/spiff

The preferred coding style is Pep 8. If you submit a patch or merge request that is not formatted with Pep 8, thats ok, it'll get cleaned up.

Spiff is a side effect of SYNHAK. You can find some of the developers and users in #synhak on chat.freenode.net.
